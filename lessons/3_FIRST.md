# First repository

In this lesson, we will use Git to make a repository. A repository is a collection of documents that we're storing under version control, such that we can keep track of changes and undo them if needed.

1. Open file explorer, and make a new folder on your desktop. Name the new folder: `first-repository`.
2. Enter the folder and open the command line or Git bash.
3. Enter the following command: `git init`.

Now that we have made a repository we should put some stuff in it... We will do this in the [next lesson](4_TRACKING.md).
